package polymorphism;

// when we talk about polymorphism - we think about 3 concepts: 1.interfaces, 2.abstract classes, 3.inheritance
// inheritance, is a technique in which we create new class on the basis of an existing one and we extend its capabilities
// abstract class -> for example we have 3 vacuum cleaners classes - all uses the same method for charging - we could create
// basic class with common method for charging and extend the class later, crating 3 different classes for different type of cleaner
// but creating object from class where is only one method has no sense - better is to create abstract class
// abstract class is a class where we create code common for all classes extending this class, but its object we cannot created
// we can create object for concrete class but not for abstract class
// a difference between abstract class and interface is - that interface defines what a given type of object will do, but not how
// e.g. we want to have clean floor, but it dousn't matter by which object it should be done - brush, or cleaner
// we can not create object of interface, when we implement given interface we have to use all its methods,
